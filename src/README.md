</p>

A FastAPI application that enables Slalom consultants to register their capabilities and manage consulting expertise across the organization.

## Features

- View all available consulting capabilities
- Register consultant expertise and availability
- Track skill levels and certifications
- Manage capability capacity and team assignments

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

2. Initialize the database schema via Alembic:

   ```
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

   Optional: override the database target with an environment variable.

   ```
   export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./src/data/capabilities.db
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc
   - Capabilities Dashboard: http://localhost:8000/

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/capabilities`                                                   | Get all capabilities with details and current consultant assignments |
| POST   | `/capabilities/{capability_name}/register?email=consultant@slalom.com` | Register consultant for a capability                     |
| DELETE | `/capabilities/{capability_name}/unregister?email=consultant@slalom.com` | Unregister consultant from a capability              |

## Data Model

The application uses a consulting-focused data model:

1. **Capabilities** - Uses capability name as identifier:
   - Description of the consulting capability
   - Skill levels (Emerging, Proficient, Advanced, Expert)
   - Practice area (Strategy, Technology, Operations)
   - Industry verticals served
   - Required certifications
   - List of consultant emails registered
   - Available capacity (hours per week)
   - Geographic location preferences

2. **Consultants** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Practice area
   - Skill level
   - Certifications
   - Availability

Data now persists in a local SQLite database by default (`src/data/capabilities.db`) and can be configured via `DATABASE_URL` for other environments.

## Database Migrations

Use Alembic for all schema changes:

```
alembic revision -m "describe change"
alembic upgrade head
```

Avoid ad hoc SQL updates so schema evolution remains repeatable across environments.

## Future Enhancements

This exercise will guide you through implementing:
- Capability maturity assessments
- Intelligent team matching algorithms  
- Analytics dashboards for practice leads
- Integration with project management systems
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
